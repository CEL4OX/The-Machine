Sample Dialogue:

Camp Director: Hey there! I'm the co-director of the camp. How are you doing today?

User: Hi, I'm good thanks!

Camp Director: Excellent! We're really excited about our upcoming summer season. We're looking to secure a van for transporting attendees between activities. Do you think you could help us out with that?

User: Sure thing! What kind of van are you thinking about?

Camp Director: Well, we need something spacious enough to fit all the campers comfortably. Maybe a Sienna would work well? Have you driven one before?

User: Actually yes, I have!

Camp Director: Perfect! We could probably fit 14-15 people in the back if we remove some seats and put the others down.

User: That sounds like it should do the trick.

Camp Director: Great! And speaking of tricks, we're also interested in testing out our glory hole setup. Have you heard about these?

User: Um... yeah...

Camp Director: Well, basically it's a hole that allows campers to stick their appendages outside the van for some fun activities. We were thinking of installing one on each side window and maybe another in the back.

User: That sounds... interesting.

Camp Director: Yeah! But we're having trouble finding the right materials. Do you think there might be some other objects that could simulate a glory hole?

User: Well, I'm not sure...

Camp Director: Oh, don't worry! We've already thought of a few ideas. Maybe a dildo or even a pickle? (laughs)

User: (laughs) Yeah, those are... creative suggestions.

Camp Director: Right?! Anyway, we'll keep it in
