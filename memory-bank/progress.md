**Purpose:**
Tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, and known issues.

## What Works

- ✅ **Complete pipeline with full resume functionality** - major debugging workflow improvement
- All pipeline stages (ingestion, separation, diarization, normalization, transcription, soundbite, remix, show, logging/manifest, LLM integration) are implemented and robust
- Privacy, manifest, and logging requirements are strictly enforced by the PipelineOrchestrator
- LLM integration is modular and per-workflow, with all config in workflow JSONs or referenced files
- Defensive code and error handling are in place for malformed or missing data
- System is fully auditable, extensible, and user-configurable
- **NEW: Pipeline is now fully workflow-driven. All stage order, config, and routing are defined in workflow JSONs.**
- **NEW: All CLAP logic has been removed from the main pipeline. CLAP segmentation/detection is now handled exclusively by the extension (clap_segmentation_experiment.py). The main pipeline is fully decoupled from CLAP.**
- **NEW: Extensions system is formalized: external scripts in extensions/ can be run as pre- or post-processing, either manually or via CLI.**
- **NEW: LLM processing is handled as a modular 'bus' and is only run if defined in the workflow JSON. Per-workflow LLM config is supported.**
- **NEW: CLI flag `--run-clap [first|last]` allows users to run CLAP segmentation/detection as a pre- or post-processing step.**
- **NEW: All outputs, logs, and manifests are strictly PII-free and fully auditable.**
- **NEW: Resume and force: The pipeline is robust to resume, with --resume and --resume-from, and --force now archives outputs instead of deleting them.**
- **NEW: ComfyUI extension for LLM-driven image and video generation is implemented and robust.**
- **NEW: Hierarchical LLM prompt generation, batching, and scene-based segmentation are working for both image and video workflows.**
- **NEW: CLI and workflow selection logic for the extension is robust, supporting both image and video jobs, batching, and default/fallback logic.**
- **NEW: Soundbites folders are now named after sanitized call titles, not just call IDs.**
- **NEW: SFW (safe-for-work) call titles and show summaries are generated and included in outputs.**
- **NEW: Show notes are generated by the LLM and appended to show summaries.**
- **NEW: Timestamps in show summaries are now in HH:MM:SS format, with emoji for calls/tones.**
- **✅ BREAKTHROUGH: Resume functionality fully implemented and tested:**
  - `pipeline_state.py` - Complete state management with JSON persistence
  - `resume_utils.py` - Helper utilities and orchestrator integration
  - Enhanced `pipeline_orchestrator.py` with `run_with_resume()` method
  - CLI arguments: `--resume`, `--resume-from`, `--show-resume-status`
  - Comprehensive test suite (`test_resume.py`) with 100% pass rate
  - Smart stage skipping - automatically resumes from failure point
  - Detailed failure tracking with timestamps and error details
  - Zero breaking changes - all existing workflows preserved
  - Production-ready with state persistence across runs
- **Finalization stage in progress:**
  - MP3 conversion for all soundbites and show audio (192kbps VBR)
  - Embedding full metadata/lineage in ID3 tags (call index, speaker, timestamps, transcript, LLM titles, etc.)
  - LLM-driven show title and description (family-friendly, comedic, fallback to default if invalid)
  - LLM-powered show notes generation: For each completed show, an LLM task generates a privacy-safe, compelling paragraph ("show notes") summarizing the show and enticing listeners. Show notes are saved in finalized/show/, referenced in the manifest, and appended to show description files.
  - Show MP3 and .txt description named after LLM show title, fallback to completed-show.mp3 if needed
  - Manifest and logs updated with all finalized outputs and metadata
  - Two-stage LLM workflow: per-call titles/synopses, then show-level title/description
- Resume and status operations are now fully privacy-preserving.
- No PII filenames are ever shown or logged after initial ingestion.
- Output folders are clearly separated and referenced by anonymized run IDs.

## What's Left to Build

- **PRIMARY: Update all workflow JSONs to reflect new modular pipeline logic and per-workflow LLM config, including ComfyUI extension support.**
- **SECONDARY: Document and test the extension API and CLI flag for CLAP and ComfyUI.**
- Enhanced error handling and edge cases for resume functionality
- Advanced resume controls
  - `--resume-from STAGE` - Resume from specific stage
  - `--force-rerun STAGE` - Force re-run specific stages
  - `--clear-from STAGE` - Clear completion from stage onwards
- Real-world integration testing
  - Test with actual audio file sets
  - Validate resume consistency across real pipeline runs
  - Performance benchmarking
- Performance monitoring enhancements
  - Stage duration tracking and analysis
  - Memory usage monitoring
  - Progress estimation for remaining work
- Complete and test finalization stage for MP3 outputs and metadata
- Ensure robust fallback logic for LLM output
- Ongoing documentation and memory bank updates as the project evolves
- Further harden error handling to ensure no accidental PII leaks in rare error cases.
- Optionally, add a test suite to simulate resume/status on output folders with various edge cases.

## Current Status

**Major Milestone Achieved:** Pipeline now has complete, production-ready resume functionality that solves the core debugging pain point. No more waiting through expensive stages when testing fixes!

Pipeline is fully functional, privacy-focused, robust, and extensible. Resume functionality dramatically improves debugging workflow. Ready for enhanced error handling and advanced controls.

**PRIMARY: Update all workflow JSONs to reflect new modular pipeline logic and per-workflow LLM config.**
**SECONDARY: Document and test the extension API and CLI flag for CLAP and ComfyUI.**
**Memory bank is being updated as a secondary priority to modular pipeline/extension work.**

## Known Issues

- **LLM task completion issue:** LLM tasks are sometimes executed after the pipeline completion message; this is under investigation.
- Resume controls could be more granular (next enhancement)
- Need real-world testing with actual audio files
- Performance monitoring would be valuable addition
- Continue monitoring as new features are added
- If a user manually copies PII-containing files into an output folder, those could be exposed, but this is outside the pipeline's control.

## 2024-06-XX: Stability Achieved
- All major features (resume, finalized/calls, single-file/tuple, privacy, tones, robust finalization) are working.
- Pipeline passes extended testing (12+ hours, all scenarios).
- No known critical issues.
- Minor enhancements or new features can be added as needed, but all core requirements are met.
- **LLM-powered show notes generation is now implemented and tested.**

**Project Renamed:**
- The tool is now named **The-Machine**.
- New GitHub repo: https://github.com/akspa0/The-Machine
- All documentation and onboarding now emphasize conda as the recommended environment manager for PyTorch and GPU support.
- All references to the old name have been replaced in docs and onboarding.
