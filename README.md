## Usage

Using The Machine is straightforward. Here‚Äôs a quick guide to get you started:

1. **Load an Audio File**: Start by loading your audio file into the application.

   ```python
   from machine import AudioProcessor

   processor = AudioProcessor('path/to/your/audio/file.wav')
   ```

2. **Process the Audio**: Use the built-in functions to process the audio.

   ```python
   metadata = processor.extract_metadata()
   context = processor.generate_context()
   ```

3. **Transcribe Audio**: Utilize the speech-to-text feature.

   ```python
   transcription = processor.transcribe_audio()
   ```

4. **Save Results**: Save the generated metadata and context.

   ```python
   processor.save_results('output.json')
   ```

For detailed examples and advanced usage, refer to the documentation provided in the `docs` folder.
